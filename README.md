## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension framework
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Provides testing server, build tools, etc.




### Continued development

I'm not convinced the colours are 100% correct - the ones provided in [style-guide.md](./style-guide.md) are not the ones in the previews, which makes things a little awkward. Any feedback on this is welcome.
